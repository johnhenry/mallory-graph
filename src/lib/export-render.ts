/**
 * Shared server-only rendering helpers for the export paths (2D expression,
 * 3D surface, ODE) -- the temp-dir render-to-buffer dance and the common
 * palette, extracted when the 3D/ODE paths were added
 * (johnhenry/mallory-graph#3, pass 2). Server-only: imported exclusively by
 * server-fn modules, never by client components directly.
 *
 * Historical note on 3D rendering: ecmanim 0.2.0 built its CanvasRenderer
 * around `options.camera` BEFORE `makeScene` ran, so a ThreeDScene's
 * self-installed ThreeDCamera was never the one the renderer actually
 * projected through -- a ready-made camera had to be threaded in through
 * here as a third parameter. Fixed upstream in ecmanim 0.5.0 (commit
 * b009a91): `render()` now compares `scene.camera` (by reference) against
 * the camera it built initially, and re-binds the renderer + carries over
 * pixelWidth/pixelHeight if the scene swapped in a new one in its own
 * constructor -- so a plain `this.camera = new ThreeDCamera({...})` inside
 * the Scene subclass now works with no external camera threading (see
 * `export-surface-video.ts`). One part of the old workaround is STILL
 * necessary, though: the fix only carries the *background* over via
 * `if (!scene.camera.background) scene.camera.background = background`,
 * but ecmanim's base `Camera` constructor unconditionally defaults
 * `background` to `"#000000"` when not given in its own config -- so a
 * `ThreeDCamera` built without an explicit `background` field is already
 * (truthily) black by the time that check runs, and the automatic
 * carry-through never fires. Confirmed via a standalone probe (distinct
 * frames at different times = camera orientation correctly wired; a
 * `background` omitted from the ThreeDCamera config renders black despite
 * this file's own `background: "#ffffff"` below, an explicit `background`
 * on the camera config renders correctly white) before deleting the old
 * external-camera-threading parameter.
