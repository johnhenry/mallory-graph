/**
 * Shared in-memory job store for every video-export path (2D expression,
 * 3D surface, ODE) -- extracted from export-video.ts when the 3D/ODE export
 * paths were added (johnhenry/mallory-graph#3, pass 2) so each path doesn't
 * grow its own Map/sweep/poll plumbing. One store, one poll endpoint
 * (export-video.ts's getExportVideoJob) serves them all: job ids are UUIDs,
 * so there's no collision risk across paths.
 *
 * A plain Map is still the right scale here: this app runs as a single
 * Dokku process (no multi-instance fan-out to coordinate), and jobs are
 * swept on submission so a browser that never polls again doesn't leak a
 * rendered buffer forever. Server-only: imported exclusively by server-fn
 * modules; nothing here is a server fn itself.
