/**
 * Hook-level tests for `useCell` -- the useSyncExternalStore wrapper every
 * reactive panel in this app is built on.
 *
 * INFRASTRUCTURE CHOICE (so future test-writers don't re-litigate it):
 * these tests render real React trees under node's own test runner using
 * `happy-dom` (the single testing devDependency) as the DOM shim, React 19's
 * stable `act()` export, and `react-dom/client` directly -- no
 * @testing-library/react, no react-test-renderer. Rationale:
 * - react-test-renderer is deprecated by the React team as of React 19 and
 *   warns at runtime; not a foundation to build new infrastructure on.
 * - @testing-library/react would work but adds a dependency layer whose main
 *   value (user-event simulation, DOM queries) `useCell` doesn't need -- the
 *   hook never touches the DOM; asserting on a module-level variable written
 *   during render is sufficient and keeps the harness ~20 lines.
 * - happy-dom over jsdom: lighter, faster to install, and sufficient for
 *   react-dom/client's createRoot (which just needs a real-enough Document).
 *
 * IMPORT-ORDER GOTCHA: react-dom/client must see the DOM shim on globalThis
 * at import time, but ESM static imports are hoisted and evaluated before
 * this module's body runs. So the shim is installed first in the module
 * body, and React/ReactDOM are pulled in via top-level `await import(...)`
 * afterward. Do not convert those to static imports. (`navigator` is a
 * getter-only global in modern Node and must not be assigned; React doesn't
 * need it.)
