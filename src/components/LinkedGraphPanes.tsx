/**
 * Two panes sharing one CellGraph. Each pane keeps its own
 * expression/params/timeline-duration cells (namespaced by cellId, via
 * GraphCanvas's `cellIds` factory), so they can plot independent
 * expressions -- but they share the graph's single TIME_CELL, so playing or
 * scrubbing the primary pane's transport animates both curves in lockstep.
 * Only the primary pane renders a transport; both panes turn off their own
 * `syncUrl` and this component does one combined hydrate/write instead, so
 * the URL fragment round-trips every pane's source/params/structureModulus
 * rather than just the first cell's (see graph-state.ts's v3 schema). The
 * primary pane's transport is pointed at `combinedDuration` (the max of both
 * panes' own `timelineDuration` cells) via GraphCanvas's `durationCellId`
 * prop, rather than defaulting to its own -- otherwise scrubbing/playing
 * would stop as soon as pane-a's animation ends even if pane-b's runs
 * longer. Safe to `define` here before either pane's own `timelineDuration`
 * cell exists yet: `CellGraph.get()` on an undefined id still registers the
 * dependency edge, and `useSyncExternalStore`'s subscribe-time consistency
 * check catches the resulting dirty flag and re-renders once both panes have
 * mounted and defined their own duration cells.
