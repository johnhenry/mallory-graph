//
// The compute below is defined here, before either child pane has rendered
// (and thus before either pane's own `timelineDuration` cell exists) -- its
// very first read sees `undefined` for whichever pane hasn't mounted yet
// (the 3D pane renders after the 2D one in this tree), so a bare
// `Math.max(0, undefined)` would momentarily be `NaN` until the 3D pane
// mounts and the corrected `0` propagates through. That transient NaN-then-0
// flip is exactly what tripped React's "getServerSnapshot should be cached"
// hydration warning (mallory-graph#10) -- `Number.isFinite` below guards
// against it so the very first read already settles on the value the later,
// fully-mounted recompute would produce.

/**
 * A 2D pane and a 3D surface pane sharing one CellGraph -- the same
 * reactive core (CellGraph + cell-id namespacing) that drives every 2D pane
 * in this app also drives the 3D one; only the sampling (sample-function.ts
 * vs sample-surface.ts) and rendering (Canvas2D vs Three.js) differ per
 * dimensionality. Sharing a graph here (rather than each pane owning a
 * private one) is what let the cross-pane link below (the 3D surface's
 * y=crossSectionY cross-section, highlighted in red) reuse the exact
 * default expressions -- sin(x) and sin(x)*cos(y) -- where the highlighted
 * slice at y=0 exactly traces the 2D pane's own curve, cos(0) being 1.
 * `crossSectionY` is plain component state (not a graph cell) since nothing
 * else needs to derive from it; it's passed straight to `Graph3DCanvas`,
 * which resamples the highlight itself whenever it or the 3D expression
 * changes -- also captured in linked3d-state.ts's URL/Gallery persistence,
 * so a reopened link/save restores the same cross-section highlight.
 *
 * Both panes turn off their own `syncUrl` (GraphCanvas's single-pane
 * persistence would otherwise clobber the hash with just its own state;
 * Graph3DCanvas has no persistence of its own to turn off) -- this
 * component does one combined hydrate/write instead, mirroring
 * LinkedGraphPanes's identical two-pane pattern: hydration runs in a
 * `useEffect` (after both panes' own lazy graph construction has already
 * run with their hardcoded defaultSource), writing params/structure before
 * source so each pane's lazy default-slider-seeding finds them already
 * populated.
