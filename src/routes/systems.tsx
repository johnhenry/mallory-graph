          Bridging to <code>MatrixMath</code>'s LU-based solver for a linear system. A genuinely nonlinear system
          falls back to <code>Symbolic.solveSystemNumeric</code> (damped Newton's method) automatically, finding one
          root near its default initial guess -- a system with multiple solutions may not find every one, and a
          singular system still throws rather than returning a wrong answer. Add or remove equations freely -- just
          keep the equation count matching the variable count (a square system).
