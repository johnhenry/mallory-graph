        <p>
          Click with the Point tool to place a free point (or drag an existing one), then Line/Circle to connect
          existing points. Each Line/Circle also gets a genuinely <em>dependent</em> length/radius cell reading its
          points' live coordinates — the Objects list below shows both kinds side by side. Reflect/Rotate/Translate
          each construct a new point that is itself dependent on the point(s) it was built from, so dragging a free
          point cascades through every line, circle, and transform built from it. Free points are drawn in blue,
          dependent (constructed) points in gray-blue — only free points are draggable, since a dependent point's
          position is entirely determined by what it was built from. A Line/Circle whose defining points have
          collapsed onto each other (zero length/radius) draws in amber instead — the same declarative
          condition-flag pattern <code>/multi</code> uses for root crossings and discontinuities, applied here to
          "this construction has degenerated."
