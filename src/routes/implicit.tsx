        <p>
          Unlike every other view here, this plots a relation that isn't solved for <code>y</code>. v1 is a single
          relation over a fixed (non-pannable) domain. The saddle-case (ambiguous-crossing) resolution uses the
          standard asymptotic decider -- the cell-center average of the four corner values reveals which diagonal
          pair the contour actually separates -- rather than always connecting one fixed diagonal.
