          Unlike the linked-panes view, which shares a <code>CellGraph</code> but still renders each pane on its own
          separate canvas. v1 supports plotting and free-variable sliders per row; point-dragging, exact mode,
          derivative steps, area/region shading, and finite-structure scatter stay single-expression-only for now
          (see <code>GraphCanvas</code>). Root crossings (where a curve meets y=0) are marked automatically, via a
          declarative "condition" cell decoupled from the drawing decision — the Open MCT-inspired pattern the
          roadmap flagged for flagging points of interest generally. Pairwise intersections between every currently
          visible pair of curves are marked the same way, in purple. The full state (every row, its
          color/visibility/sliders, annotations, and the viewport) lives in the URL, so reload restores the session,
          and "Fork this view" is just opening that same URL in a new tab to explore an alternate path independently.
          "+ Annotate" then click the canvas drops a labeled note at that point — click a marker or its label to
          select it, drag a selected marker to move it, edit its label in the list, or "Jump" to recenter the
          viewport on it (drag the canvas to pan, scroll to zoom, at any time) — an Open-MCT-inspired point
          annotation with cross-pane-style navigation, here within one shared view. Append <code>?embed=1</code> to this URL (or use it directly as
          an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> <code>src</code>) for a chrome-free embeddable view. Each row's "strict"
          toggle uses <code>mallory-math</code>'s <code>Symbolic.assertVariables</code>: once on, anything besides{" "}
          <code>x</code> is a hard error instead of silently becoming a new slider — useful for catching a typo
          before it turns into a spurious parameter.
