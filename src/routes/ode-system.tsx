          Via <code>Numerical.rk4</code>, which was already a vector-state (system) solver -- extending{" "}
          <Link to="/ode">/ode</Link>'s single-equation solver to two coupled equations dx/dt = f(x,y,t),
          dy/dt = g(x,y,t) only needed new glue code, not a new numerical method. v1 is fixed at 2 equations/2
          variables (the same scope cut <code>SystemSolverPanel</code> made for algebraic systems), with one
          trajectory from a single initial condition overlaid on a direction field sampled at t0 -- no
          multi-trajectory overlay, no animation.
