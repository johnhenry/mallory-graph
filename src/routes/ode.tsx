          Via <code>Numerical.rk4</code>. v1 is a single first-order equation with a fixed (non-pannable) domain.
          Before falling back to that numeric plot, it also tries <code>Symbolic.solveOdeClosedForm</code> --
          separable and linear-first-order equations with an elementary antiderivative get an exact "Closed form:"
          line above the plot, with a small button to copy its LaTeX source (most equations have no elementary
          closed form, so this is silently absent rather than an error). "Export video" renders a shareable MP4/GIF of the slope field with the RK4 solution progressively traced
          from the initial condition, server-side via ecmanim. Coupled systems of ODEs now have their own{" "}
