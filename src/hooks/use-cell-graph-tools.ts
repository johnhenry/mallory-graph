/**
 * Registers a generic list/get/set triple of WebMCP tools against one panel's
 * CellGraph -- the app-agent-drivability pass (see the plan). Every
 * CellGraph-native panel already funnels its whole state through
 * `graph.get`/`graph.set`/`graph.list`, the same introspection AlgebraView
 * shows a human, so one shared hook gives an external AI agent full
 * read/write access with no panel-specific tool-writing.
 *
 * `set_cell` refuses to touch a `dependent` (computed via `graph.define`)
 * cell: `CellGraph.set()` unconditionally clears a cell's `compute` fn, so
 * a naive "just call set" tool would silently and permanently convert a
 * reactive cell into a static one the moment an agent guessed wrong about
 * which cell was the "input." Only `free`/`unknown`-role cells are settable;
 * the error message names the free cells `list_cells` reports, so a caller
 * can self-correct without a separate discovery round-trip.
